##### POS & MRP(MTO) Integration
This module allows you to flag products as make-to-order directly from the Point of Sale. It automatically creates the corresponding manufacturing orders along with all required pickings. Additionally, it provides a POS interface to confirm the generated pickings.

### Make-to-Order Assignment

### Point of Sale
- Displays whether a product/line is make-to-order in the product list, variant pop-up, and order lines.

- Once the sale is confirmed, the picking linked to the manufacturing order(s) is created (all MOs are grouped into a single picking). The sale view then displays both the MO and picking details.
