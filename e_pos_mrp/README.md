##### POS & MRP Integration  
This module lets you flag products as make-to-order directly from the point of sale and automatically creates the corresponding manufacturing orders together with all required pickings. It also adds a POS interface to confirm the generated pickings.

### Make-to-Order Assignment

### Point of Sale  
- Shows whether a product / line is make-to-order in the product list, variant pop-up and order lines

- Once the sale is confirmed, the picking linked to the manufacturing order(s) is created (all MOs are grouped into a single picking). The sale view then displays both the MO and picking details

- A new action in the POS opens an interface where finished and pending orders / pickings can be viewed and filtered
